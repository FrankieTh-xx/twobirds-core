Welcome Birdies ;-)

**twoBirds is a ...**
- lightweight, 
- component-based, 
- event-driven / loosely coupled, 
- vanilla

**Javascript library that maps objects to DOM nodes or into other objects.**

twoBirds is as easy as jQuery, but on application/framework level.

twoBirds supports all targets and web programming use cases, so **using twoBirds alone you can...**

- **add JS functionality to an existing webpage** in the most simple way, no matter which framework was used on the server side ([Progressive enhancement:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement))

- **build a [single page application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)** from ground up

- **build a plain old website** using serverside rendering from ground up using [NodeJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js)

- **mix all of the above** to optimize for search engines, or migrate an existing serverside rendered webpage to a SPA on the fly

- **build microservices** using [NodeJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js)

- **build mobile apps** using [Phonegap/Cordova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Cordova)

- **build windows, linux and mac apps** using [Electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework))

**tB can completely replace your stack from the data source to the display**. It is one coding style using only vanilla Javascript plus some conventions and utilities.

twoBirds visible objects can be rendered on the server side and on the client side with minimal changes, or even be programmed to support both from the beginning.

### Principles

twoBirds strictly follows the [KISS](http://principles-wiki.net/principles:keep_it_simple_stupid) and [DRY](http://principles-wiki.net/principles:don_t_repeat_yourself) doctrines.

The tB core can be seen as an intermediate step between a simple wrapper/helper library like jQuery and a fully fledged JS framework. 

Like the first, it has selectors for the DOM and reasonable modification methods. 

Like the latter, it incorporates a higher level abstraction scheme for application objects.

tB is JS-linted, Jasmine tested and this package contains the complete API documentation. Technically it is the minimum possible toolkit to create an application or reusable JS library.
